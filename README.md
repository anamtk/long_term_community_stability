# Code from: Miller-ter Kuile et al. *Long-term community stability: accounting for imperfect detection to understand the contributions of current and past environmental conditions to community states*

## General description 

This is the code for a paper modeling long-term community stability in which we employed a two-stage modeling process to account for imperfect detection and then explored how environmental variables at multiple time scales influence community stability. We performed this modeling process on four long-term community datasets available from published sources:


| Dataset                                          | Years     | Number of sites | Number of species | Source | 
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Santa Barbara Channel LTER fish                  | 2000-2022 | 43             | 63                | [Reed and Miller 2022](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=17&revision=37) |
| Konza Prairie LTER passerine birds               | 1981-2009 | 11             | 78                | [Boyle 2023](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-knz.26.12) |
| Sevilleta LTER grasshoppers                      | 1992-2019 | 60             | 46                | [Lightfoot 2021](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sev.106.214969) |
| Petrified Forest National Park understory plants | 2007-2022 | 70             | 84                | [Swan and Ploughe 2023](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2300890) |

## Code structure

Each dataset has a similar file and folder organization structure that corresponds to the two-part modeling process.
